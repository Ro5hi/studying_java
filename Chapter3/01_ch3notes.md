**There are two types of variables**

- Primitive
    Primitives are like cups at a coffee house. They come in different sizes and each have a different name.
    You may see those cups displayed in order. In Java, Primitives come in different sizes and those sizes have names.
    When you declare a variable in Java, you must declare it with a specific type. 
    
    **The sizes for the six numeric primitives:**

    || long   (64 bits) -huge to huge
    ll int    (32 bits) -2147483648 to 2147483647 
    ii short  (16 bits) 32768 to 32767
    ,, byte   (8 bits)  -128 to 127

    Floating points:

    ll float (32 bits) varies
    || double (64 bits) varies

    Ex: float f = 32.5f;
    // Note the 'f'. Gotta have that with a float because Java thinks anything with a floating point is a double, unless you use 'f'.

    "I'd like an int please with the value of 2486, and name the variable height", each primitive variable has a fixed number of bits (cup size).

    **The eight primitive types are**
    
    boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double



- Object reference


**Reserved List of Keywords**

- Java's keywords and other reserved words (in no useful order). If you use these for names the compiler will be very, very upset.

boolean , byte, char, double, float, int , long, short, public, private, protected, abstract, final, native, static, strictfp, synchronized, transient, volatile, if, else, do, while, switch, case, default, for, break, continue, assert, class, extends, implements, import, instanceof, interface, new, ackage, super, this, catch, finally, try, throw, throws, return, void, const, goto, enum

Reserved words are keywords (and other things) the compiler recognizes.
