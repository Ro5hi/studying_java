**There are two types of variables**

- Primitive
    Primitives are like cups at a coffee house. They come in different sizes and each have a different name.
    You may see those cups displayed in order. In Java, Primitives come in different sizes and those sizes have names.
    When you declare a variable in Java, you must declare it with a specific type. 
    
    **The sizes for the six numeric primitives:**

    || long   (64 bits) -huge to huge
    ll int    (32 bits) -2147483648 to 2147483647 
    ii short  (16 bits) 32768 to 32767
    ,, byte   (8 bits)  -128 to 127

    Floating points

    ll float (32 bits) varies
    || double (64 bits) varies

    "I'd like an int please with the value of 2486, and name the variable height", each primitive variable has a fixed number of bits (cup size).

Variables must have a name and a type.
