Every Java application has to have at least one class and at least one main method.
Every statement MUST end in a semicolon ";".

- Public: So everyone can access it.
- Void: The return type means there's no return value.
- String[]: Arguments to the method. This method must be given an array of Strings. And the array will be called args.

System.out.print VS System.out.println 
- .println : Prints in a new line. 
- .print : Keeps printing on one line.

Operators
- The assignment operator is "="
- The equality operator uses "=="
- < (less than)
- > (greater than)

Java has three standard looping constructs: while, do-while, and for. 
The key to a loop is the conditional test, an expression that results in a boolean value.

- While:
A while loop runs everything within its block as long as the conditional test is true. If the conditional test is false, the while loop code block won't run and execution will move down to the code immediately after the loop block.

- Do-while:

- For:
