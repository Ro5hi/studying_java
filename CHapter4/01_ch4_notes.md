**Remember: a class describes what an object knows and what an object does**
___________________________________

A class is the bluepint for an object. When you write a class, you're describing how the JVM should make
an object of that type. You already know that every object of that type can have different instance variable values.
But what about the methods?

**Can every object of that type have different method behaviour?**

Every instance of a particular class has the same methods but they can behave different based on the value of the
instance variables.
